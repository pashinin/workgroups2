Each entry should be a list containing an identifier symbol, a
prompt string, and a function form that's funcall'd to produce
the filtered buffer-list.

The prompt string is displayed as part of the minibuffer prompt
when its filter is active.

The function form should be either a function-symbol or a lambda, and
should take two arguments: a workgroup and a list of live Emacs
buffers.  The function should return a new list of live buffers,
typically by filtering its second argument in some way.

Default buffer-list-filters include:

`all'           All buffer names

`associated'    Only the names of those live buffers that have
                been associated with the current workgroup

`unassociated'  Only the names of those live buffers that are
                unassociated with the current workgroup

`fallback'      A special case used to fallback to the
                original (non-ido/iswitchb) Emacs command.
                `fallback' isn't actually a buffer-list-filter

                `wg-buffer-list-filter-order-alist' just the

A few example custom buffer-list filtration functions are

`wg-buffer-list-filter-irc' and `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp'.
See their definitions for more info on how they're defined, and
the utilities they're built on.

Here's an example of how to add an `elisp' buffer-list-filter

example function `wg-buffer-list-filter-elisp':

(add-to-list
 'wg-buffer-list-filter-definitions
