;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Workgroups2 is an Emacs session manager.  It is based on the
;; experimental branch of the original "workgroups" extension.
;;
;; If you find a bug - please post it here:
;; https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2/issues
;;
;; Quick start,
;;
;; - `wg-create-workgroup' to save window&buffer layout as a work group
;; - `wg-open-workgroup' to open an existing work group
;; - `wg-kill-workgroup' to delete an existing work group
;;
;; Optionally, you can use minor-mode `workgroups-mode' by put below
;; line into .emacs ,
;;
;; (workgroups-mode 1)
;;
;; Most commands start with prefix `wg-prefix-key'.
;; You can change it before activating workgroups.
;; Change prefix key (before activating WG)
;;
;; (setq wg-prefix-key "C-c z")
;;
;; By default prefix is: "C-c z"
;;
;; <prefix> C-c    - create new workgroup
;; <prefix> C-v    - open existing workgroup
;; <prefix> C-k    - delete existing workgroup
;;
;; Change workgroups session file,
;;
;;   (setq wg-session-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs_workgroups")
;;
;; Support some special buffer (say `ivy-occur-grep-mode'),
;;
;;   (with-eval-after-load 'workgroups2
;;     ;; provide major mode, package to require, and functions
;;     (wg-support 'ivy-occur-grep-mode 'ivy
;;                 `((serialize . ,(lambda (_buffer)
;;                                   (list (base64-encode-string (buffer-string) t))))
;;                   (deserialize . ,(lambda (buffer _vars)
;;                                     (switch-to-buffer (wg-buf-name buffer))
;;                                     (insert (base64-decode-string (nth 0 _vars)))
;;                                     ;; easier than `ivy-occur-grep-mode' to set up
;;                                     (grep-mode)
